However, Inazuma Eleven 3 Spark was never officially localized in English, so many fans of the series have been looking for a way to play it in their language. Fortunately, there is an unofficial English patch that you can download and apply to the game, which will translate most of the text and menus into English. Here is how you can do it:
  
1. First, you need to have a Nintendo DS emulator on your computer or mobile device. There are many options available online, such as DeSmuME, NO$GBA, or DraStic. You can also use a flashcart if you have a physical Nintendo DS console.
2. Next, you need to download the original Japanese ROM of Inazuma Eleven 3 Spark from a reliable source. You can find it by searching online, but make sure you have a legal copy of the game before downloading it.
3. Then, you need to download the English patch file from this link: [https://drive.google.com/file/d/13zIHhdRHKDcqvgTg6KwP-TwVzbto0xKI/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/13zIHhdRHKDcqvgTg6KwP-TwVzbto0xKI/view?usp=sharing). This patch was created by a fan group called Inazuma Naichi, and it is based on the official European version of Inazuma Eleven 3 Team Ogre Attacks[^2^].
4. After that, you need to extract the patch file using a program like WinRAR or 7-Zip. You will get a folder with two files: xdelta.exe and IE3Spark.xdelta.
5. Now, you need to apply the patch to the ROM using xdelta.exe. To do that, open xdelta.exe and click on "Apply Patch". Then, select IE3Spark.xdelta as the patch file, select your Japanese ROM as the source file, and choose a name and location for your patched ROM as the output file.
6. Finally, you can load your patched ROM on your emulator or flashcart and enjoy playing Inazuma Eleven 3 Spark with English subtitles. Note that some parts of the game may still be in Japanese, such as voice clips, animations, and some minor texts. However, you should be able to understand most of the story and gameplay without any problems.

In conclusion, Inazuma Eleven 3 Spark is a fun and exciting game that you can play on your Nintendo DS with an English patch. If you are a fan of soccer and RPGs, you should definitely give it a try. You can also check out some videos of the game on YouTube[^1^] [^2^] to see how it looks like. Have fun!

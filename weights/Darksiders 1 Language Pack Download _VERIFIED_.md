The numbers after the equal sign indicate your game version. For example, if you see "Version = 1.0.0.1", then you have the original release of the game.
 
## Step 2: Download the language pack
 
The next thing you need to do is to download the language pack that matches your game version. You can find various language packs online from different sources. However, we recommend using this website[^1^] as it has verified and updated language packs for Darksiders 1.
 
On this website, you can find language packs for English, Spanish, French, Italian, German, Polish, and Russian. You can also find subtitles for other languages such as Portuguese, Turkish, Czech, Hungarian, and more. To download a language pack, simply click on the link that corresponds to your game version and language preference.
 
For example, if you have the original release of the game (version 1.0.0.1) and you want to change it to English, then you can click on this link[^2^]. This will download a zip file named "Darksiders\_1\_0\_0\_1\_EN.zip". Save it to your computer and extract it using a program such as WinRAR or 7-Zip.
 
## Step 3: Replace the language files
 
The final thing you need to do is to replace the language files in your game's folder with the ones from the language pack. To do this, go back to your game's folder that you opened in Step 1. Then, go to WillowGame > Localization. You will see folders for each language that are named with abbreviations such as INT (international), GER (German), RUS (Russian), etc.
 
Delete or rename the folder that contains your current language files. For example, if your game is in Russian, then delete or rename the RUS folder. Then, copy and paste the folder from the language pack that contains your desired language files. For example, if you want to change it to English, then copy and paste the INT folder from the zip file that you downloaded in Step 2.
 
## Step 4: Enjoy the game
 
That's it! You have successfully downloaded and changed the language pack for Darksiders 1. Now you can launch the game and enjoy it in your preferred language. You can also change other settings such as audio and subtitles from the main menu of the game.

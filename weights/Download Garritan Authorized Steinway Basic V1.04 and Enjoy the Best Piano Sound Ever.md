The Garritan Authorized Steinway Basic V1.04 offers a single perspective of the piano sound, which is the close audience perspective. This means that you can hear the piano as if you were sitting in front of it in a concert hall. The Basic version is available in downloadable format only, and it requires 2 GB of hard drive space and 2 GB of RAM[^3^]. The Basic version also supports Windows XP, Windows Vista (32-bit and 64-bit), and OS X (PPC and Intel 32-bit and 64-bit)[^3^].
 
The Garritan Authorized Steinway Basic V1.04 uses the ARIA Player engine, which is a standalone application that can also be used as a plug-in with most major DAWs. The ARIA Player allows you to adjust various parameters of the piano sound, such as tuning, pedal noise, sympathetic resonance, reverb, EQ, and more. You can also use MIDI controllers to control the dynamics, expression, and timbre of the piano[^1^].
 
The Garritan Authorized Steinway Basic V1.04 is a great option for students, amateur musicians, and educators who want to experience the authentic and musical sound of a Steinway concert grand piano without breaking the bank. You can purchase and download it from the Garritan website for $99[^1^]. If you want more sample data and more perspectives of the piano sound, you can also check out the Professional and Standard versions of the Garritan Authorized Steinway virtual instrument[^1^].
  
One of the features that sets the Garritan Authorized Steinway virtual instrument apart from other virtual pianos is the use of convolution reverb. Convolution reverb is a technique that uses recordings of real spaces to create realistic and natural reverberation effects. The Garritan Authorized Steinway Basic V1.04 includes several convolution reverb presets that simulate different acoustic environments, such as concert halls, churches, studios, and living rooms. You can also adjust the reverb level, size, and decay time to suit your preferences.
 
Another feature that enhances the realism and expressiveness of the Garritan Authorized Steinway virtual instrument is the use of half-pedaling and re-pedaling techniques. Half-pedaling allows you to control the amount of damping on the strings by varying the pressure on the sustain pedal. Re-pedaling allows you to catch the notes that were released before the pedal was pressed again. These techniques allow you to create more nuanced and dynamic performances with the virtual piano.
